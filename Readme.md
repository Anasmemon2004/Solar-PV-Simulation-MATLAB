# Solar PV System Power Output Simulation Using MATLAB

This MATLAB project simulates how the power output of a solar photovoltaic (PV) system changes throughout the day based on varying sunlight (irradiance).

## 📌 Project Description

- Simulates solar irradiance between 6 AM to 6 PM
- Calculates power output using standard PV formulas:
  `Power = Irradiance × Area × Efficiency`
- Graphs generated:
  - Solar Irradiance vs Time
  - Power Output vs Time

## 🔧 Tools Used
- MATLAB (basic scripting)
- Plotting using `plot()` and `subplot()`

## 📁 Files Included
- `solar_pv_output_simulation.m` — MATLAB source code
- `graph1.png`, `code.png` — simulation output screenshots
