# Solar-PV-Simulation-MATLAB
A MATLAB-based simulation project that models the power output of a solar PV system over time based on varying solar irradiance. Includes real-time irradiance modeling, power output calculations, and visual plots. Ideal for demonstrating understanding of renewable energy systems and MATLAB scripting.
Solar PV System Power Output Simulation Using MATLAB
This MATLAB project simulates how the power output of a solar photovoltaic (PV) system changes throughout the day based on varying sunlight (irradiance).

üìå Project Description
Simulates solar irradiance between 6 AM to 6 PM
Calculates power output using standard PV formulas: Power = Irradiance √ó Area √ó Efficiency
Graphs generated:
Solar Irradiance vs Time
Power Output vs Time
üîß Tools Used
MATLAB (basic scripting)
Plotting using plot() and subplot()
üìÅ Files Included
solar_pv_output_simulation.m ‚Äî MATLAB source code
graph1.png, code.png ‚Äî simulation output screenshots
